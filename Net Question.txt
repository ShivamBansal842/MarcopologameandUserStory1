Question : when should you use linq in your program?

Answer : It stands for Language Integrated Query. We are using LINQ to Objects and the Objects part is any IEnumerable collection.  
It enables us to query and manipulate data independently of data soureces. It's like a query language which can query any data source and any transform. 
It also provides full type safety and compile time checking. 
LINQ is intended to make it easy to query data sources.NET Framework includes libraries that allow anyone to create a LINQ provider that can query any data source. 
LINQ providers that make it easy to query specialized data sources.

For Example :

Suppose you have following code :

foreach (Animal animal in Animals)
{
    if (animal.Legs == 4)
    {
        foundAnimals.Add(animal);
    }
}
return foundAnimals;

You can reduce this code in single line only using LINQ as below:

return Animals.Where(a => a.Legs == 4).ToList();
